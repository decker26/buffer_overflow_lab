# 🛡️ Buffer Overflow Exploit in Python 3 🐍

## Overview ℹ️

Welcome to the Buffer Overflow Exploit repository! This project showcases a Python 3 script designed to exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities. 🚀 Buffer overflows are a prevalent security threat, allowing attackers to inject malicious code into a program's memory. This exploit script demonstrates the process of crafting and executing such exploits to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code on a target system. 🎯

## Features ✨

- **Python 3 Compatibility:** The exploit script is written in Python 3, ensuring portability and ease of use across different platforms.
- **Educational:** This project aims to educate users on the mechanics of memory corruption vulnerabilities and the exploitation techniques involved.
- **Customizable:** The script can be customized and extended to suit specific exploitation scenarios or target applications.
